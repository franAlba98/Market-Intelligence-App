# Market-Intelligence-App
A step-by-step RAG app for long-term investment analysis using LangChain, Ollama (local LLM), HuggingFace embeddings, and Chroma. It scrapes Tesla documents (press releases; falls back to SEC filings if unavailable), chunks and embeds them, retrieves with MMR for diverse context, and runs an LCEL chain for answers.
